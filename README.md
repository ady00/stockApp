# stockApp
A basic app that displays information on a particular stock. Stocks can be chosen in the search bar, and the app will display Open, Close, High, Low, and a daily chart.
stockApp uses Streamlit, a python library to automate the frontend for basic microapplications.
This app was designed more to test Streamlit's features for my own learning than to be an actual application. Might come back to this later.
